# Smart Devices
The purpose of this exercise is to examine the functions and capabilities of the Internet of Things nodes. In this exercise we use NodeMcu as one of the IoT nodes. A NodeMCU board is an open source hardware platform suitable for IoT projects that require wireless connectivity. <br>
In the following sections there is a brief description about each of the projects implemented.

## Table of Contents
- Hello World
- Binary Counter
- PWM and ADC
- water level sensor with PWM

## Hello World
This is a simplest project in IoT world that just shows a predefined text on the terminal.

## Binary Counter
Create a binary counter using three external LEDs (LEDs External). With each passing second, the counter value increases by one, and when it reaches the maximum value, it starts counting from zeroo again.

## PWM and ADC
Explaining the usage of PWM and ADC units in microcontrollers

## water level sensor with PWM
Using a water level sensor and PWM, write a piece of code that measures the water level inside a container and, in addition to displaying the value in the software terminal, changes the intensity of a buzzer. The lower the water level in the container, the louder the buzzer should sound.
